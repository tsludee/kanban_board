# kanban_board_tsludee
 this is a Kanban board written in Python using Tkinter for its GUI

## goal
i want to maximize workflow. oftentimes i find myself struggling to focus on certain tasks. this board will help me set limits on what i am working on.

## elements of a Kanban board
### visual signals
i would like the following items on each work card to help signal my workflow:
- dates
- color coding for urgency/status
- clear title for task
- clear notes for task requirements

### columns
part of what makes a kanban board effective is limitations. i will only include the following columns:
1. to do (square symbol)
2. in progress (plus symbol)
3. help (star symbol)
4. review (exclamation symbol)
5. questions (question symbol) 
6. complete (check symbol)

### work in progress limits
i need to establish work in progress (wip) limitations for myself. the columns above will have the following maximums:
1. unlimited
2. 3
3. 3
4. 3
5. 3
6. unlimted

### commitment point
the backlog for the board - i would like to add functionality that establishes the date/time for when an item is put on the board. i would like to also add in functionality that marks the date/time for when the card moves from one column to the next. finally, when an item moves from "to do" to "in progress" i want to set a deadline that can affect the card's color to let me know where i am in approaching the deadline.

### delivery point
at the end of workflow, i would like to be able to review all the data above and take notes on what was effective/ineffective

## current task(s)
i am just beginning this project. i have outlined goals and what i would like to achieve. i am starting to write basic code to outline the above elements

## where i am stuck:
no hiccups yet -- just getting started
